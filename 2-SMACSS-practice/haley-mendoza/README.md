##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I followed the general guidelines on the README for this lab and placed styling in the files that I thought were the best fit.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No, I just cut and paste the existing code in style.css into the appropriate SMACSS css files.
