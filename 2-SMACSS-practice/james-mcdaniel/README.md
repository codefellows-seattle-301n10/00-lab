##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Most of them fit neatly into the guidelines provided.  A few of them are less clear, like HRs, or the Nav LIs, so I guessed on a few of them.  I considered each one with the criteria of "is this a structural piece that holds other elements together, or is this an element that fits into an existing structure?" to  determine if things should go into layout.css (structural) or modules.css (smaller piece).  base.css only received formatting that would apply to the entire page.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No.  I'm sure if I had a better understanding of CSS there are some redundancies that could be worked out, but at this point I'm just happy I touched something without breaking it.
