##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(for base i decided that anything that was over all not that speciffic was going to be at base lvl. )

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(had to redirect a background image. ../img/ImagePath. and delete and image that wasn't in directory.)
