##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(Put your answer here)
Based on the rules that I read on SMACSS documentation I have moved each of css elements to respective group or module.
Base: 
all styles related to html, body, main and input elements

Layout:
Here everything that forms the layout can be included like header, nav, aside,wrappers, section, footer.

Modules:
This is kind of confusing a bit. Most of these modules are sub elements of layout. For example, inside layout there can be modules like logo, image, recipe.
