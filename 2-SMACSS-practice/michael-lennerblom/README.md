##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

For the base I only put a couple things, the background for the page and the font.  The layout, I put the main nav, aside, section, and the footer.  Everything else is in the module.css

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

Actually, no I just left it.  I was just happy to sort the different css files.  I also did not add the l- to the layout styles.(in the interest of time for tonight)
