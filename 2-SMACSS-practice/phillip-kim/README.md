##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Based on the general guidelines on the lab assignment, I did my best to identify all the elements that affected the overall styling in the body.  Surprisingly the list was small.  Then I identified the CSS that affected overall classes/IDs/ and boxes in the layout.  Finally, anything that affected elements within the above classes/IDs, I threw into the modules CSS file.  Hopefully this is the correct method for SMACSS guidelines.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

Due to time constraints within lab tonight, I did not do any refactoring, though I can see where refactoring would be beneficial for this assignment.
