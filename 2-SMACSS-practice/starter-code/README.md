##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(Put your answer here)

firstly I went by what would make sense to me of where i would look for a certain item in those files. then i used the discriptions in the readme as well and they were helpful. finaly i made sure the the page looked the same while doing changes and how they affected the page.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

no, i used the items already there, just put them in the seperate files. everything seemed to look good.
