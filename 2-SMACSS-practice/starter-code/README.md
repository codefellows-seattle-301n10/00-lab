##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I used SMACSS as a **ROUGH** guideline. It's still difficult to follow a strict set of sorting rulee. Sometimes it makes sense to keep certain selectors together for easier reference, but I can see how that would change easily depending on the scale of the application and the architecture.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not, as I limited myself to 45 minutes on this and didn't really have time to get into that. If I did, I might have taken certain selectors and separated them into their respective stylesheets for a bit more granularity.
