##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I used mainly things that go in the body, change font, or background color in the base.css. For layout.css I put all of the header, nav bar things. modules.css I put the pictures and the list items.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I moved more things into the base.css such as the footer even though it has an image because I felt like it was part of the whole body as well.
