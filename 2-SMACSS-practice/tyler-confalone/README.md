##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I put anything with the pound sign in the layout file.  I put things with element selector into the base.css.  Anything with a class I put in the modules.css

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not do any refractoring of the existing CSS, I am now second guessing that.
