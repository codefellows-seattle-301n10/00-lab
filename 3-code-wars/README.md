# Code 301... Code Wars!

Part of growing as a programmer is to practice, practice, practice. Throughout this course, there will be regular Code Wars challenges.

### Whiteboarding

Get together with your partner and read through the challenge. There are several items to accomplish, as time allows:
  - Read through the challenge and make sure you understand what is being asked.
  - Pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Pseudocode can be described as writing out your plan in human-readable form. For example, `set up a counter` or `multiply each value by 2`.
  - You should **not** be writing any actual code, only referencing Code Wars for the problem domain.
  - **Take a picture** of your whiteboard pseudocode solution. This will be included in your personal repo and is part of the individual assignment requirements for full points.
  - You should now move on to attempting to write the solution on Code Wars.
  - You'll know your solution is correct when all of the tests pass and turn green. Only then can you add your solution to your repo.

### GitHub repo

As part of the assignment, create a new repository on GitHub to track your Code Wars solutions throughout 301. This repo should have a README.md file with an overview of the purpose of the repo.

Work on a new branch for each challenge. For example, for today's challenge you can make a new branch with the command `git checkout -b replace-all-dots`. When you finish the assignment each day, make a new pull request from your challenge branch to your master branch and submit the URL in Canvas.

Within your repo, you should create a separate folder for the current Code Wars challenge. As we progress throughout this course, you will be creating a new folder for each solution, so start off with an organized repo!

Each folder should have the name of the challenge. Within each folder, you should include the following:
  - README.md file with the description of the problem domain from Code Wars, a link to the challenge on Code Wars, and an overview of your process for solving the challenge.
  - Picture of your pseudocode from the whiteboarding exercise (except for the first individual assignment when you set up your repo)
  - JavaScript file of your solution *after confirming that it passes on Code Wars*. Your TAs will be confirming that your solution passes the tests, so make sure that it is complete before adding it to your repo. Besides, you wouldn't want a potential employer to see your broken code!

### Code Wars Challenge

1. Complete [today's Kata.](https://www.codewars.com/kata/fixme-replace-all-dots)
2. Create a new branch for today's challenge.
3. Make a new folder in your Code Wars repository on Github. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of today's challenge.
4. This folder should contain:
  - A file named "solution.js" which contains the JavaScript solution after confirming that it passes on Code Wars with green passing tests
  - A README.md which includes the problem domain from Code Wars and a link to the challenge
5. Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch.
6. Submit a link to your PR on Canvas.
